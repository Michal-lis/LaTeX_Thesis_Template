\section{L-C method implementation}

The risk mission assessment presented in this work will follow the L-C method steps specified in the table 4.1 from the previous subsection. In order to understand the requirements of the program based on NASA standards and which mission-specific actions could cause failure, some other space mission risk case studies were analyzed, including a report "Risk Management for the NASA/JPL Genesis Mission: A Case Study" published by NASA \cite{genesis}, a case study of the ARMADILLO satellite presented in the document by Brumbaugh \cite{Brumbaugh} and "Report on Project Management in NASA" produced by the Mars Climate Orbiter Mishap Investigation Board in order to maximize the possibility of success for future similar missions \cite{mro}.
